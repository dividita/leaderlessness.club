# LRC: Leaderlessness Research Club

**Our mission** is to practically implement and experiment with forms of
leaderless organization, paving the path for other organizations to follow.

How we achieve our mission:

  * Conduct and publish field research on existing organizations using
    leaderless organization
  * Create and publish summaries, critiques, and reviews of existing materials
    on forms and anthropologies of (hopefully implementable) leaderless organization
  * Facilitate discussions, offer presentations, and create general public
    events regarding implementing and experimenting with leaderless organization
  * Offer feasible guides on implementation of great reductions of bureaucracy
  * Offer guides on eschewing surveillance in regard to business ontologies,
    how do withdrawal forms of labor which managerialism cannot do without
  * Publish original leaderless organization implementation manuals and guidebooks,
    report on experiments regarding our real world example-implementations of
    these manuals and guidebooks, from the high level overall system to the
    components (like consensus)
  * Answer public questions on leaderless organization implementation
