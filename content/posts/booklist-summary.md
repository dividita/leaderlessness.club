# Starting Research with a Booklist

**Note: this article is incomplete and will be routinely updated for a while
because I am impatient. I intend to make future posts elaborating on books and
concepts mentioned herein, which I'll be sure to link to within this article.**

I am summarizing knowledge from books I've read recently, while offering my own
interpretation. I hope that not only will this booklist provide quality
suggestions for the LRC's book club, but that my summaries and conclusions will
bring the LRC closer to its goal of creating an informed proposal for an
Internet-based group decision-making process, in other words, a collective
management system, to then be developed into a web app.

For each book I'll try to provide:

  * A summary
  * The author(s)
  * Why I chose this book/found it relevant to LRC
  * How I found out about the book
  * Eventually I'll add links later if more thorough blog posts are made about
    them

Tying this booklist together is the notion that hierarchal ideologies (statism
and capitalism, for example) infect our imagination (Capitalist Realism). These
ideologies sculpt our pedagogy (The Ignorant Schoolmaster), our anthropology
(Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology) and our history (Hellenistic History
and Culture, Writing Culture) in their image, through the "collective fiction"
(Capitalist Realism) of _the big Other_.  The consequences of this are not all
as easy to spot as starvation, exploitation, poverty, and imperialism, and one
of the most insidious parts of these hierarchies is that they convince us that
nothing else is possible.  How we act and live in this collective fiction
is often in direct contradiction with our internalized individual beliefs or
knowledge.  A method of combatting the statist ideology is summarized well by
Capitalist Realism and Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology:

  * Produce a viable alternative, e.g., argue a delivery where neoliberalism
    has failed: a massive reduction of bureaucracy.
  * Struggle over work and who controls it, assertion of worker autonomy (as
    opposted to control by management) together with a rejection of certain
    kinds of labor (such as auditing) which managerialism cannot do without
  * Reject business ontologies
  * Realize the unhealthiness of certain systems...
  * Resolve things through collective management, practically and experimentally
  * Join the LRC today! (some kind of action link here) we are the alternative!
    We build it and experiment with its practical application of collective
    management constantly!

## Background

I founded Hypatia Software Organization some years ago (put date, just year is
ok) to help solve the problems that people at the intersection of poverty and
transmisogyny face.  In retrospect, leaderlessness (can be anarchy still if ur
fine using that word now) was a natural conclusion of our experiments with
mutual aid and consensus. While I think Hypatia is a good example of mutual aid
in action, I think that given what we know now and what we learned from (and
continue to learn from) that experience, there is potential for so much more.
This is why Leaderlessness Research Club is so important and amazing: it
provides a way to generalize these patterns in an approachable way so that
other organizations can apply them to things beyond our consideration. In fact
I would argue that this is the necessary conclusion of our experience with
Hypatia since a bunch of ragtag trans people (as we are) can't handle every
single possible idea that could benefit from our leaderlessness framework
without resorting to hierarchies, therefore invalidating the project. [XXX:
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS LAST SENTENCE EVEN SAYING?!]

Hypatia Software Organization is an independent system fostering mutual aid and
generative justice, via outreach and ideological-warming, abiet within current
capitalist statist modes of production. "Warming" should be looked at in the
context of the boiling frog, whereby people not necessarily aware of the
ideology support it incrementally. While "socialism" is a call for communism
within "Capitalist Realism", "leaderlessness" is perhaps a call for anarchy
within a "Statist Realism." The act of warming will hopefully pave the way for
a completely anarchist form of governance and commodity production, as people
realize that not only as an alternative possible, but it is in fact preferable
to the current order of things.

Hypatia Software Organization is a system fostering mutual aid, generative
justice, that is outreach and ideological-warming, independent, but within
current capitalist statist modes of production. "Warming" as in the boiling
frog, whereby people not necessarily aware of the ideology support it
indirectly, whereby "socialism" is a call for communism within a Capitalist
Realism, "leaderlessness" is perhaps a call for anarchy within a "Statist
Realism." This warming gradually becomes a completely anarchist form of
governance and commodity production.

FOSS/web projects are moved by emergent social interactions, rather than
traditional corporate structures.
FOSS advocates were a good initial target, for whom a leaderless system
could be considered more palatable then most other types, simply due to
prior exposure to emergent patterns and how they craft software.

I was (ironically) confronted by classism within Hypatia when there was a push
by the Board of Directors to remove or restrict the cash relief program,
largely due to a particular homeless beneficiary. I viewed this disconnect as
an example of the misrepresentation intrinsic to hierearchal forms of
representation. The path I used to represent member's voices was simple: to
actually incorporate their voices via consensus. Consensus is a pillar of
anarchy, and as I studied it more I finally arrived at leaderlessness.

David Graeber defines "revolutionary action" in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as:

> A revolution on a world scale will take a very long time. But it is also
> possible to recognize that it is already starting to happen. The easiest way
> to get our minds around it is to stop thinking about revolution as a
> thing--"the" revolution, the great catacylsmic break--and instead ask "what
> is revolutionary action?" We could then suggest: revolutionary action is any
> collective action which rejects and therefore confronts, some power of
> domination and in doing so, reconstitutes social relations--even within the
> collectivity--in that light. Revolutionary action does not necessarily have
> to aim to topple governments. Attempts to create autonomous communities in
> the face of power (using Castoriadis' definition here: ones that constitute
> themselves, collectively make their own rules or principles of operation, and
> continually reexamine them), would, for instance, be almost by definition
> revolutionary acts. And history shows us that the continual accumulation of
> such acts can change (almost) everything.

I absolutely think Graeber is taking the right approach here, particularly as
breaking into underprivileged communities and working with them to improve
their situations is concerned. That is, I'm performing my own "revolutionary
action" by pushing the _reality_ of leaderless systems.

## Timeless Tips for 'Simple Sabotage'

Here’s a list of five particularly timeless tips from the Simple Sabotage Field
Manual:

  1.  Managers and Supervisors: To lower morale and production, be pleasant to
inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against
efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.
  1.  Employees: Work slowly. Think of ways to increase the number of movements
needed to do your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one; try to make a
small wrench do instead of a big one.
  1. Organizations and Conferences: When possible, refer all matters to
committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the
committees as large and bureaucratic as possible. Hold conferences when there
is more critical work to be done.
  1. Telephone: At office, hotel and local telephone switchboards, delay putting
calls through, give out wrong numbers, cut people off “accidentally,” or forget
to disconnect them so that the line cannot be used again.
  1. Transportation: Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy
personnel. Issue two tickets for the same seat on a train in order to set up an
“interesting” argument.

## The Tyranny of Structurelessness

_The Tyranny of Structurelessness_ by Jo Freeman references the
anarcha-feminism movement, specifically outlining how when powers remain opaque
and informalized, they're at their most tyrannical. At-a-glance Freeman may
seem to suggest that there cannot possibly be transparency within any anarchist
movment, but I believe the bigger takeaway underlines the importance of formal
systems of organization. My friend Xax told me about this article some years
ago.

"There's no such thing as structureless group," Jo Freeman poses that there are
only formal and informal structures and that structurelessness (informal
structure) only serves to mask power:

> A "laissez faire" group is about as realistic as a "laissez faire" society;
> the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish
> unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established
> because the idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation of
> informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly "laissez faire" philosophy
> did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing control over
> wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented the government
> from doing so.

The informal structure (especiall of of unstructured groups) forms the basis for elites.
An elite is a small group of people who have power over a larger group which
they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group,
often without their knowledge or consent.  (REWORD: pagerism)
Freeman illustrates elitism as nepotism: that people with external friendships
to each other will have communication networks, consulting each other in
decisions, often sharing in the same values and orientations not even by
conspiracy, those involved with these networks will have more power than those
who don't. Sometimes two or more of such "networks" or "friend groups" will
compete for power within the group. Informal communication networks are
invitably exclusive and elitist. A comparison is drawn that informal systems of
male-hedgamony are one such network of elites, and that much struggle in
women's movement has been to formalize the inclusion of women..? 

Political impotence and principles of democratic structuring.... some key points I found relevant:

  * Task oriented
  * High degree of communication
  * Delegation, including responsibility for whatever delegated
  * Distribution of authority
  * Rotation of tasks among individuals
  * Allocation of tasks along rational criteria.
  * Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible.
  * Equal access to resources needed by the group.
  * Structure of the group formalized
  * Everyone is aware of the rules of how decisions are made; open and
    available to everyone
  * For everyone to have the opportunity to participate the structure must be
    explicit (formalize the rules!)

## Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making

"Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to
Widespread Agreement" by Tim Hartnett is the first book we discussed a the LRC
book club. I first came across the CODM model on [the Wikipedia page on
consensus
decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making). At
the time I was the president of the nonprofit I founded, [Hypatia Software
Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org). I was attempting to incorporate
the voices of the very members the nonprofit benefitted, since the board of
directors was at time disconnected from the members' concerns.

Tim Hartnett's background as a marriage counselor and facilitator, a PHD in
psychology, shines as this decision-making approach not only addresses
pragmatic concerns, but the emotional interplay which ultimately determines the
fairness of the process.

When Leaderlessness Research Club started it initially was only a software
project called "Dividita." The goal of Dividita was to provide a
decision-making model that would make heirarchicalless/leaderless organization
easily replicatable to successfully run organizations (businesses, art
collectives, nonprofits, etc.). I had found some success with Hypatia Software
Organization and I had experimented with other leaderless groups and having
experienced the feasibility, effectiveness, and fairness which they provided, I
thought it was important to make such a process easily replicatable and usable.
David Graeber defines _revolutionary action_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as direct action which subverts
the necessity for the state, the application of real leaderless solutions, and the
proposal of such systems, in fact David Graeber states:

> It’s not just that anarchism does not tend to have much use for high
> theory.  It’s that it is primarily concerned with forms of pracice; it insists,
> before anything else, that one’s means must be consonant with one’s ends; one
> cannot create freedom through authoritarian means; in fact, as much as
> possible, one must oneself, in one’s relations with one’s friends and allies,
> embody the society one wishes to create

> The key term in the new movement is “process,” by which is meant,
> decision-making process. In North America, this is almost invariably done
> through some process of finding consensus. This is as I mentioned much less
> ideologically stifling than it may sound because the assumption behind all good
> consensus process is that one should not even try to convert others to one’s
> overall point of view; the point of consensus process is to allow a group to
> decide on a common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and down,
> then, proposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until one ends
> up with something everyone can live with.

_Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making_ does exactly that, with some exceptions,
it offers a feasible, tried and tested method for consensus...

The CODM model consists of seven steps:

  1. Framing the topic
  2. Open discussion
  3. Identifying underlying concerns
  4. Collaborative proposal building
  5. Choosing a direction
  6. Synthesizing a final proposal

## Hellenistic History and Culture

_Hellenistic History and Culture_ by Peter Green begins with a forward on the
perspective from which the book extrapolates new information:

> A distrust of all ideologies has altered old views of ancient political
> structures, and feminism has also changed earlier assessments. The current
> emphasis on multiculturalism has consciously deemphasized the Western,
> Greco-Roman tradition, and Nubians, Bactrians, and other subject peoples of the
> time are receiving attention in their own right, not just as recipients of
> Greco-Roman culture.

> History, like Herakleitos' river, never stands still. These essays share a
> collective sense of discovery and a sparking of new ideas—they are a welcome
> beginning to the reexploration of a fascinatingly complex age.

postcolonial theory thing which weaves into Writing Culture, ...

## The Politics of Fear

Wodak...
Friend at LRC recommended this to me...

## Writing Culture

_Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography_ by James Clifford
(editor), George E. Marcus (editor), Mike Fortun (foreword), and Kim Fortun
(foreword). This is the 2010 version, "This seminal collection of essays
critiquing ethnography as literature is augmented with a new foreword by Kim
Fortun, exploring the ways in which Writing Culture has changed the face of
ethnography over the last 25 years."
Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI.

Hopefully helps with field research. This in the vein of postcolonial theory,
related to _Can the Subaltern Speak?_ by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and The
Ignorant Schoolmaster, and perhaps even Capitalist Realism, which poses what
Zizek defined as "ideology:" that which we don't know we know; the systemic
proliferation of statist, capitalist ideology into academia.

## Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology

_Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology_ by David Graeber asks us to think
about the inherent anthropological structures behind political theories.
From this context Graeber unveils an equation of the state to kinship systems,
definitions for revolutionary action, the streangths of anarchy, and anarchy's
historical role (what anarchy has historically been concerned with).
Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI. I thought this book would be
relevant to LRC because it provokes thought deeper than the system itself,
while simultaneously concerning itself with a framework for these systems
(which Graeber calls "an anthropology.").

Graeber's sentiment is echoed in many of the books on this list, of Zizek's
concept of _ideology_, The Ignorant Schoolmaster's topic of systemic statism
(how the state embues itself into everything we do), that we not only must
become aware of our assumptions, the _anthropology_ of any system we may
implement.

## The Ignorant Schoolmaster

_The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation_ by 
Jacques Rancière. Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI...

Helps with generativity?

## The Postmodern Condition

_The Postmodern Condition_ by Jean-Francois Lyotard...

Postmodernism as a postcolonial abstraction: the imaginary isolation of science
and societal abstraction; the death of meta...
https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/lyotard.htm
"The ruling class is and will continue to be the class of decision makers. Even
now it is no longer composed of the traditional political class, but of a
composite layer of corporate leaders, high-level administrators, and the heads
of the major professional, labor, political, and religious organisations. "
Grand narratives are the analysis of history through a lense of an origin and
inevitabel destination, postmodernism destroys this narrative with more nuanced
understanding; Marxim analyzes history through the lense of class from the
means of labor to labor immancipation, and for anarchism from serfdom to
"increasingly democratic" means of governance--it is perhaps for this reason
that Graeber identifies not as an anarchist but as someone who believes that
anarchy is an action, that it is an anthropology, and that this is the ver
ystrength of anarchism: that is concerns itself far more with the action and
implmentation and practical, than aligning itself with grand narratives for
interpreting history and our trajectory through some sort of _grand narrative_,
and it is thus Graeber is a very postmodern anthropologist believer of
anarchist action.
Possibly in the vein of queer theory: where bisexuals are caught between due to
outmoded grand narratives of sexuality opression, TERFs exist in the same vein
of outmoded grand narratives of *sexual* opression.

## Capitalist Realism

_Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?_ by Mark Fisher illustrates an
imagination landscape infected by capitalist _ideology_ and provides tools for
navigating the "collective fiction" which reinforces it.

Recommended to me by a friend at LRC. I thought this book would be useful to
LRC because it introduces of those tools which can decipher our preconceptions
about systems of organization, enabling us to both think outside the box, while
having the diagnostics and caveats to guide us on our periless journey to
increasingly larger scale leaderless systems of organization in the real world.

Capitalist Realism perpetuates itself with _ideology_.  My favorite
explaination of "ideology" is Zizek's tongue-in-cheek extension of [Donald
Rumsfeld's "amateur
philosophizing,"](http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636):

> Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to
> me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we
> know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are
> some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we
> don't know we don't know

Zizek uses this to highlight a missing term: the "unknown knowns," the things
we don't know that we know. One of those things we don't know that we know is
that "we can have whatever we want as long as someone's selling it." That it is
this boundless hedonism which acts as the symbolic in economic policy.  Our
minds excuse the contradiction of our participation with the overvaluation of
our beliefs, and it is through this sort of object do we practice the symbolic
of existence in capitalism, and it is the imaginary that these beliefs
ultimately amount to anything, and the real again is exploitation and
environmental destruction. However, I don't think this is to say that companies
aren't doing more to destroy the environment than you could ever make up for by
having every person in the US drive electric, recycle, compost, and all these
things.  Instead I believe this provides a compass for navigating the ideology
of capitalism; the symbolic, the real, the imaginary, these terms help us
navigate and understand the big Other.  Fisher refers to _the big Other_ as a
"collective fiction," the symbolic, the imaginary, and the virtual all
encourage us to buy into these collective fictions despite the real, and when
there's nothing left to encourage us to buy into those collective fictions it
adapts, sometimes these adaptations are subtle, seemingly insignificant, and
sometimes the adaptations are cataclysmic.

The 2008 banking crisis is an example of the role the Symbolic plays in
capitalism realism--that while we individually internalize the faults of
capitalism, it is not registered by the big Other, and thus it remains. Zizek
illustrates this with a joke about a madman who, when cured of believing he is
a kernel of corn and is released from care, promptly returns after encountering
a chicken. The surprised doctor asks "But why, you are cured of believing
you're a kernel of corn!" To which the madman replies, "Yes, but does the
chicken know?" We are aware that capitalism is terrible,  and yet we
unconciously ask ourselves "But does the big Other know?" and thus it remains
because to us it has not been registered by the big Other.  Another example of
Zizek's language, "the Symbolic," is given, illustrated through PR, branding,
and advertising, whereby the corporation's true nature is _sheathed_:

> Ratner precisely tried to circumvent the Symbolic and "tell it how it is,"
> describing the inexpensive jewelry his shops sold as "crap" in an
> after-dinner speech. But the consequence of Ratner making this judgment
> _official_ were immediate, and serious - £500m  was wiped off the value of
> the company and he lost his job. Customers might previously have known that
> the jewelry Ratners sold was poor quality, but the big Other didn't know; as
> soon as it did, Ratners collapsed.

It is through _the big Other_ which capitalist ideology is reinforced through
these terms in understanding how this collective fiction is maintained:

  * The imaginary of perpetual growth. The imaginary is the layer aside reality
    we perceive and value equally.
  * The symbolic of work and consumption. The symbolic is how we interact
    through the big Other.
  * The real of exploitation and environmental destruction. The real may be
    something that is even fully actualized among individuals, but they are
    submerged in the "collective fiction" of the big Other.

I like the way [Zimbardo's _The Lucifer
Effect_](https://archive.org/details/TheLuciferEffectUnderstandingHowGoodPeopleTurnEvilISBN9781400064113)
depicts the extremes of the big Other:

> Aberrant, illegal, or immoral behavior by individuals in service professions, 
> such as policemen, corrections officers, and soldiers, is typically labeled the mis- 
> deeds of "a few bad apples." The implication is that they are a rare exception and 
> must be set on one side of the impermeable line between evil and good, with the 
> majority of good apples set on the other side. But who is making the distinction? 
> Usually it is the guardians of the system, who want to isolate the problem in order 
> to deflect attention and blame away from those at the top who may be responsible 
> for creating untenable working conditions or for a lack of oversight or supervision.
> Again the bad apple-dispositional view ignores the apple barrel and its
> potentially corrupting situational impact on those within it. A systems
> analysis focuses on the barrel makers, on those with the power to design the
> barrel.

Kafka illustrates the structure of disavowal inherent to bureaucracy with a
quest to reach the authority who will finally resolve K's official
status. This quest can never end, because ultimately there are only officials
engaged in acts of interpretation about what the big Other's intentions are,
and that these acts of interpretation, deferrals of responsibility, are all the
big Other is. This makes me think of Graeber's _against policy (a tiny
manifesto)_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology:_

> The notion of “policy” presumes a state or governing apparatus which imposes
> its will on others. “Policy” is the negation of politics; policy is by
> definition something concocted by some form of elite, which presumes it knows
> better than others how their affairs are to be conducted. By participating in
> policy debates the very best one can achieve is to limit the damage, since the
> very premise is inimical to the idea of people managing their own affairs.

There isn't a need for self and managerial surveillance. The effect of knowing
whether you will be observed or not will inevitably result not in quality, but
diligence as a bureaucrat. The self-surveillance of teachers provides an
illustration of what reinforces the participation/belief in the big Other, that
"collective narrative:"

  * The Imaginary: If we pass these metrics we are doing great
  * Symbolic: People gear education toward success on these metrics
  * Reality: [Math class needs a makeover (TED
    Talk)](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_meyer_math_curriculum_makeover).
    Students learn to pass tests, not to have deep, fundamental understandings.

All of this is packaged nicely by this paragraph in Capitalist Realism:

> There are certainly conspiracies in capitalism, but the problem is that they
> are themselves only possible because deeper level structures allow them to
> function. "Does anyone really think, for instance, that things would improve if
> we replaced the whole managerial and banking class with a whole new set of
> ("better") people? Surely, on the contrary, it is evident that the vices are
> engendered by the structure, and that while the structure remains the vices
> will reproduce themselves."

Capitalist Realism outlines these methods of change:

  * Remove business ontology from (public) services. In regard to LRC I think
    about our "key performance indicators."
  * Produce a viable alternative. LRC needs to not only research and prepare
    for the unintuitive caveats of real implementations of leaderlessness, but
    it needs to balance this with real-world application and experimentation, and
    proposals for methods for accomplishing such.
  * Assertion of worker autonomy (as opposed to control by management)
  * Withdraw, evade forms of labor which "will only be noticed by the
    management which have no effect on the delivery[...] but which
    managerialism cannot do without." Reject these managerial-types of labor (such
    as auditing). Institute industrial action against managerialism in general.
  * Realize the unhealthiness of these systems

This is a powerful conclusion to the book:

> It is clear that consumer self-regulation and the market will not by themselves
> avert environmental catastrophe. Unlimited license (re: ceaseless "progress" in
> hedonism) leads to misery & disaffectionment, then limitations placed on desire
> are likely to quicken, rather than deaden, it. In any case, rationing of some
> sort is inevitable. The issue is whether it will be collectively managed, or
> wheter it will be imposed by authoritarian means when it is already too late.
> Quite what forms this collective management should take is an open question,
> one that can only be resolved practically and experimentally.

It is then apparent that the priority is to bypass the symbolic, much like
Ratner and Khrushchev did, in a sense making it beyond a doubt that this
collective fiction we've bought into, the big Other, can no longer possibly
believe its narrative and it must adapt. The Leaderlessness Research Club
provides the revolutionary action of real world application of leaderless
organization which will be a part of the first steps in this process in
realizing the alternative.

I think it's rather strange how close the goals of Leaderlessness Research Club
are to all of this just through the concept of leaderlessness.

## Questions & answers

Here's a conversation I had with someone, but I've changed it up a bit to be
more informative and digestible.

Q: Are all these political? Tyranny of Structurelessness, The Politics of
Fear, Writing Culture, etc., give me that impression.

A: Depends on what you mean by "political." For example, The Politics of Fear
gives us a framework for rhetoric, The Tyranny of Structurelessness a framework
for unstructured opression, etc. I see this kind of political theory as an
organizational reserach theory much larger in scope. It is the framework which
describes the operations of society akin to anthropology (which Graeber
highlights as a glaring lack of interdisciplinary understanding with regards to
systems of organization).

Q: I see you include books which don't tackle leaderlessness, like Capitalist
Realism and Das Kapital. I'm not sure what they have to do with anything?

A: "Capitalist Realism," for example, is composed of sources like Zizek who are
statist anti-capitalists, however, the framework it provides is a useful
language for describing larger concepts.

Q: These do sound like they're framed in a highly academic, and a very
particular kind of academic at that, tone and language. I strongly dislike
academia, principally for the politics and that they are completelydisconnected
with reality. Academics, people who've spent their entire adult life living in
the sphere of academia don't understand what life outside an ivory tower is
like.

A: Then you'd probably enjoy reading  "The Ignorant Schoolmaster." The ideology
(Zizek) of statism affects this too--pedagogical ideology as academia, again,
statism casts a reflection of itself here as well, that even in our concept of
education it is a statist conceptualization, education is a prescriptive
system: the teacher and the student.  In the first chapter of _Fragments of an
Anarchist Anthropology_, Graeber delvies into anarchy being inherently
incompatible with academia today. That one of the core features of anarchy is
concerning itself more with application than high theory, however this doesn't
omit room for high theory.  Consider this, you talk about how people in the
ivory tower are completely dissonant on what's going on around them--this is a
result of that state mentality, it is that when you become a teacher that you
are "house trained" and that you inevitably lose connection as you become
ever-submerged in an academic culture which demands you speak their language
and articulate their ideals.  I trace this back to again: the reflection of
statism reflects itself across a fractal of society. _Writing Culture_ talks
about how academia can never be representative so long at it is statist (as
does the ignorant schoolmaster and David Graeber's fragments of an anarchist
anthropology).

Q: So when you say "statist" do you mean the presence of a power dynamic?  Or
do you mean the presence of some organized hierarchical structure of society ?
I still fail to see how it's germane to the teacher/student relationship as it
exists now and how it has existed for ages

A: David Graeber poses a falseness of the postmodern, of "modernity", because
from the anthropological identification of capitalism and statism they are
kinship systems, kinship systems which have persisted, that fundamental
societal interplay negating any sense of postmodernity through some great
cataclysmic change (in fact change has never operated this way, but that's
another topic).  The conceptualization of a shift from kinship systems to
something greater, "an enlightenment" of democracy shifting us away from the
aforementioned, is this very kind of "cataclysmic change" I specify as being
nonexistant, and thus no such postmodernism exists.  When I say "state" I mean
exclusive power, the prescriptive, the policy, the ability a nonmajority to
hold exclusive power as a few over the many. If you want an introduction to
anarchist theory _Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology_ offers a great
framework.

Q: What scale are you talking about in terms of organization?

A: Again, I mean: "[the state] creates a reflection of itself across a fractal
of society." at every scale of society, affecting organization at every scale,
statism is an anthropological way of our life--a thing we do not know we know.
For example, postcolonial theory states that those from outside of a culture
misrepresent those they attempt to document inherently because they are
representatives and those observations are formed from an exclusive 

Q: Describe how Zizek uses the word _ideology_, and what "a reflection of
itself a cross a fractal of society" means more precisely, since I am
unfamiliar with Zizek and I don't know if there are subtleties to the meaning
of the latter beyond "you can observe this phenomenon in a variety of scales in
society."

A:  Zizek uses the word "ideology" to mean "what we don't know we know" and
uses that framework to describe the danger of capitalism is that it does not
use the old repressive methods of Stalin-esque propaganda, but rather
implements itself through this kind of "ideology," again, in regard to "a
reflection of itself across a fractal of society" means that statism and
capitalism imbues itself its mentality its essence its "ideology" (Zizek again
here as we talked about) through everything we do because it is exactly that:
that which we do not know we know, and as such, it is our understanding of
organization and interplay for any scale of society.  It is this interesting point
Zizek delivers: this is how capitalism is maintained, rather than, again,
Stalin-esque maintenance through propaganda.

Q: Why do you disagree with Zizek's conclusions that a state is necessary?

A:  Because his conceptions of anarchist modes of decision-making are
outmoded, because the advent of technology brings possibilities of automating
consensus and direct democracy. However, Zizek's views are more complicated
than this (e.g., the selfish locality in a globalist network of humanity).

Q: Who decides which methods are used?

A: This is a complicated topic. It's both that revolutionary action is the
subversion of the state by basically replacing it, but on the other hand within
the state it is ultimately controlled by the state and the general anthropology
interplay

Q: How do you counteract the desire for power?  I can't imagine a world in
which people don't pursue the accumulation of power.  Perhaps there exist a
group of people whose predisposition is to exist at the top of a social
hierarchy. There are those who will connive to usurp the structures in place to
gain power to use for their benefit, but if you have any concentration of power
it inherently becomes one in which a hierarchy exists. I see anarchy as a
highly unstable system a high energy state, so to speak, in which the system
will try to reach a more stable equilibrium by a redistribution of power (its
actors pursuing this end). On that topic, how does a military without a
hierarchy exist?

A: It is true in any system that people will have a desire for power. Please
"The Tyranny of Structurelessness" and my analysis of it.  Also, _Mutual Aid: A
Factor of Evolution_ is really good as it summarizes Darwinian relation to
human anthropology (Kropotkin was a close friend of Darwin).  I recommend it
because mutual aid does seem to be THE factor of the world's most proliferated
species. People can govern through a formalized general agreeance and enforce
it in the same way.  That is, what about the concentration of power of
confederate will?  As long as the people get to have order over the military's
actions anarchies can obviously create societal contracts with representative
structures like nuclear facilities and the military where snap judgements are
required.  The important thing is that ultimately the policy and direction of
society is set by a ruling few and that these services answer to those ruling
elite and not the general populous, i.e., in this case the military holds no
exclusive power over "policy." I hate to talk about "the military" and "policy"
in this way and in the scope of this booklist, but it does seem to draw some
useful parallels and analogies to other services an anarchy might
utilize/render.

Q: So the mob dictates the actions of others? Isn't this tyranny of the
majority?

A: If you utilize the concepts, the ideology, behind _The Tyranny of the
Majority_ then you have to accept that democracy itself is futile.  I and
others have proposed the tyranny of tyranny itself is the real hazard.  Also,
if you believe this, then why trust people to elect representatives in the
first place?  We instead are forced into a system in which a kinship system
allows us to only vote for rich families who have long maintained state
structures.

Q: But won't abuses of power always happen because power exists and people are animals?

A: So why aren't you an anarchist? Zimbardo posed it is not the "bad apples,"
but rather the ill soil creating toxic trees. Anarchism is fundamentally posing
that the state creates the ill soil, enabling power to be abused by the few who
will act in disregard of the many (those we label as the exceptions, the "bad
apples").  We should collectively and democratically decide, as a people, what
our societal agreement is, which these agreements can affect/effect services of
society, even those with "necessary hierarchy" like the military, those
services are still ultimately accountable and managed by the people, rather
than what we have now where elites decide to go to war on our behalf (Iraq,
Afghanistan, Libya, etc.).  Historically war has not been the role of the
people but rather the role of people in power to decide.  If you seem to agree
with these ideals, then why prevent yourself--why not aim for something better?
Surely statist capitalism is not the end all be all (in fact _Capitalist
Realism_ is a book which describes the problem in society now where we cannot
imagine existence without capitalism [and i would say statism as well]).  "If
you're not a utopianist you're schmuck," and so anarchism provides a framework
you apparently agree with that we can move toward through revolutionary actions
of making anarchism paradigm.

Q: I think that any violent or sudden means to change society will inherently
result in a worse system and I think that the system is too entrenched to be
changed nonviolently.

A: I personally am a pacifist-but this is likely a position of privilege. It's
important to realize legislative violence exists and that almost all "peaceful
movements" that drastically changed society have been accompanied by an equal
violent movement along side it.  So it's conflicting but ultimately I would say
that 1. I'm a pacifist and I don't believe killing people to get things done,
and 2. Zizek brings up how in _V for Vendetta_ ends with the government being
overthrown. The problem is what happens in _V for Vendetta: Part 2_, what
happens after they've overthrown the government requires a specific plan or
something worse will take its place.  I don't believe in violent overthrows,
but this does trace back to something important: that anarchism is concerned
with the practical implementation, the actual plan of an alternative to
capitalist statism. This is the failing of the left: an inability to provide an
actual alternative rather than kneejerk "poverty is bad" type protests .  Zizek
and capitalism realism talk about this tendency in GREAT detail and even talks
about how this kind of thing is not only systemic of capitalism, but it
supports capitalism as it overvaluates belief, i.e., "I believe capitalism is
bad and therefore it is okay for me to be complicit in its operation," either
fullstop or in the self-tricking like citizen-level environmentalism or
choosing the ethical product will ultimately solve its issues--this very
concept of capitalist realism in which we cannot create an alternative to
capitalism, but can only imagine remedying its worst excesses.

Q: I don't think you need a leader for everything you participate in, that
forcing a leadership role isn't wise.

A: I think its most important that people who are ultimately a part of a system
ultimately have control over that system and regardless of who they employ to
render their will (not in the republic sense because this generates exclusive
power over the aforementioned), as we talked about with military.

Q: none of this seems like its something practical that we can control

A: You can subvert the state through the revolutionary action of creating
paradigm through implementation of anarchism.  The Black Panthers realized
this through direct action by implementing services like: breakfast program,
lawyer tiplines, etc.  The biggest issue in leftist politics rn is actually
formalizing an explicit alternative. Anarchism has taken the place of Marxism
in modern academic culture it is a prohibited speech except where used in
coded language through topics like mutual aid, direct democracy, etc., but it
is in these practical applications that the paradigm is set, the revolutionary
action is played, as was Marxism, increasingly anarchist application and theory
becomes an inevitability, so did Marxism entering the sphere introduce to the
public acceptance of "socialism," and a possibility of someone like Bernie
Sanders (though this again is in the "worst excesses" thing we talked about
earlier, this surely exemplifies what I speak of here).
