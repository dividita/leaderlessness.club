# Starting Research with a Booklist

**Note: this article is incomplete and will be routinely updated for a while
because I am impatient. I intend to make future posts elaborating on books and
concepts mentioned herein, which I'll be sure to link to within this article.**

I am summarizing knowledge from books I've read recently, while offering my own
interpretation. I hope that not only will this booklist provide quality
suggestions for the LRC's book club, but that my summaries and conclusions will
bring the LRC closer to its goal of creating an informed proposal for an
Internet-based group decision-making process, in other words, a collective
management system, to then be developed into a web app.

For each book I'll try to provide:

  * A summary
  * An interpretation
  * The author(s)
  * Why I chose this book/found it relevant to LRC
  * How I found out about the book
  * Eventually I'll add links later if more thorough blog posts are made about
    them

I founded Hypatia Software Organization some years ago (put date, just year is
ok) to help solve the problems that people at the intersection of poverty and
transmisogyny face.  In retrospect, anarchy was a natural conclusion of our experiments with
mutual aid and consensus. While I think Hypatia is a good example of mutual aid
in action, I think that given what we know now and what we learned from (and
continue to learn from) that experience, there is potential for so much more.
This is why Leaderlessness Research Club is so important and amazing: it
provides a way to generalize these patterns in an approachable way so that
other organizations can apply them to things beyond our consideration. In fact
I would argue that this is the necessary conclusion of our experience with
Hypatia since a bunch of ragtag trans people (as we are) can't handle every
single possible idea that could benefit from our leaderlessness framework
without resorting to hierarchies, therefore invalidating the project. [XXX:
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS LAST SENTENCE EVEN SAYING?!]

Hypatia Software Organization is an independent system fostering mutual aid and
generative justice, via outreach and ideological-warming, abiet within current
capitalist statist modes of production. "Warming" should be looked at in the
context of the boiling frog, whereby people not necessarily aware of the
ideology support it incrementally. While "socialism" is a call for communism
within "Capitalist Realism", "leaderlessness" is perhaps a call for anarchy
within a "Statist Realism." The act of warming will hopefully pave the way for
a completely anarchist form of governance and commodity production, as people
realize that not only as an alternative possible, but it is in fact preferable
to the current order of things.

FOSS/web projects are moved by emergent social interactions, rather than
traditional corporate structures.  FOSS advocates were a good initial target,
for whom a leaderless system could be considered more palatable then most other
types, simply due to prior exposure to emergent patterns and how they craft
software.

I was (ironically) confronted by classism within Hypatia when there was a push
by the Board of Directors to restrict the cash relief program, largely due to a
particular homeless beneficiary. I viewed this disconnect as an example of the
misrepresentation intrinsic to hierearchal forms of representation. The path I
used to represent member's voices was simple: to actually incorporate their
voices via consensus. Consensus is a pillar of anarchy, and as I studied it
more I finally arrived at leaderlessness.

David Graeber defines "revolutionary action" in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as:

> A revolution on a world scale will take a very long time. But it is also
> possible to recognize that it is already starting to happen. The easiest way
> to get our minds around it is to stop thinking about revolution as a
> thing--"the" revolution, the great catacylsmic break--and instead ask "what
> is revolutionary action?" We could then suggest: revolutionary action is any
> collective action which rejects and therefore confronts, some power of
> domination and in doing so, reconstitutes social relations--even within the
> collectivity--in that light. Revolutionary action does not necessarily have
> to aim to topple governments. Attempts to create autonomous communities in
> the face of power (using Castoriadis' definition here: ones that constitute
> themselves, collectively make their own rules or principles of operation, and
> continually reexamine them), would, for instance, be almost by definition
> revolutionary acts. And history shows us that the continual accumulation of
> such acts can change (almost) everything.

I absolutely think Graeber is taking the right approach here, particularly as
breaking into underprivileged communities and working with them to improve
their situations is concerned. That is, I'm performing my own "revolutionary
action" by pushing the _reality_ of leaderless systems.

Some of these books may be political, however, all of them offer insight for
LRC's goal of creating a proposal for a leaderless decision-making process that
will be turned into an app. I see a lot of these books as an extention or
forethought for organizational research, these topics are essential in
implementing a system of humans, to name a few: rhetoric (The Politics fo
Fear), framework of unstructured oppression (The Tyranny of Structurelessness),
anthropology (David Graeber), ideology (Capitalist Realism), pedagogy (The
Ignorant Schoolmaster), ethnography (Writing Culture), linguistics (Language
and Symbolic Power).

Some of these books were perhaps prohibatively academic, and I was lucky to
have time to do the background-research to fully understand those; this is
something touched upon by both The Ignorant Schoolmaster and Language and
Symbolic Power. It can also be said that often academics are disconnected to
the realities which they describe, even if they had an impoverished past (this
has been referred to as "house training"). I believe this is why ethnography
(Writing Culture) is so important to include. Graeber's anthropology also
speaks to this (ethnography is a subfield of anthropology). Truly, does this
not all describe an inherent issue with the hierarchical mindset, is it not
"statist realism?"

The scope of scale for this organizational research is hopefully significant
enough to at least inch us forward for the organizational structures of small
groups, all the way up to an alternative to the state. This statist realism is
reflected in questions like "So the mob dictates the actions of others? Isn't
that tyranny of the majority?" or "But won't abuses of power always happen
because power exists and people are animals?" Here I believe Zimbardo paints an
entertaining picture about "bad apples" vs. "bad barrels." It is in fact the
exploitability of these power dynamics which not only enables such abuses of
power, but encourages encourages the growth of bad behavior.

Surely we can all admit that there are some things which leadership roles don't
even make sense and are unwise. Experimentation with these models subverts
statism by finally registering it with the big Other, that is to say, to
finally infuse the feasibility of leaderlessness and highlight the terribleness
of statism through juxtaposition, to make this paradigm through accumulative
action.

The biggest issue we face is creating an explicit alternative to capitalist
statism. Anarchism has taken the place of Marxism in modern academic culture.
Anarchism is a prohibited speech except where used in coded language through
topics like mutual aid, direct democracy, etc. However, through quotidian
application the alternative becomes realized, the paradigm is set, it is
registerd with the big Other.

Tying this booklist together is the notion that hierarchal ideologies (statism
and capitalism, for example) infect our imagination (Capitalist Realism). These
ideologies sculpt our pedagogy (The Ignorant Schoolmaster), our anthropology
(Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology), our history (Hellenistic History and
Culture, Writing Culture), and even gender (Gender Trouble) in their image.
The consequences of this are not all as easy to spot as starvation,
exploitation, poverty, and imperialism, and one of the most insidious parts of
these hierarchies is that they convince us that nothing else is possible.  How
we act and live in this collective fiction is often in direct contradiction
with our internalized individual beliefs or knowledge.

I think even more fundamental to these experiences was anarchist schooling and
constantly experiencing the horror of the loss of my autonomy.

Authoritarian narrative (trap exclusionary feminism lol), removal of autonomy,
this is Gender Trouble.

talk about gender realism in article

talk about how graber basically better defines what capitalist realism
does--amy mentioned something about linguisitic  and academic elitism. that
some language is exclusive af "academese."

## Capitalist Realism

_Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?_ by Mark Fisher illustrates an
imagination landscape infected by capitalist _ideology_ and provides tools for
navigating the "collective fiction" which reinforces it.

Recommended to me by a friend at LRC. I thought this book would be useful to
LRC because it introduces of those tools which can decipher our preconceptions
about systems of organization, enabling us to both think outside the box, while
having the diagnostics and caveats to guide us on our periless journey to
increasingly larger scale leaderless systems of organization in the real world.

Capitalist Realism perpetuates itself with _ideology_.  My favorite
explaination of "ideology" is Zizek's tongue-in-cheek extension of [Donald
Rumsfeld's "amateur
philosophizing,"](http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636):

> Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to
> me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we
> know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are
> some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we
> don't know we don't know

Zizek uses this to highlight a missing term: the "unknown knowns," the things
we don't know that we know. One of those things we don't know that we know is
that "we can have whatever we want as long as someone's selling it." That it is
this boundless hedonism which acts as the symbolic in economic policy.  Our
minds excuse the contradiction of our participation with the overvaluation of
our beliefs, and it is through this sort of object do we practice the symbolic
of existence in capitalism, and it is the imaginary that these beliefs
ultimately amount to anything, and the real again is exploitation and
environmental destruction. However, I don't think this is to say that companies
aren't doing more to destroy the environment than you could ever make up for by
having every person in the US drive electric, recycle, compost, and all these
things.  Instead I believe this provides a compass for navigating the ideology
of capitalism; the symbolic, the real, the imaginary, these terms help us
navigate and understand the big Other.  Fisher refers to _the big Other_ as a
"collective fiction," the symbolic, the imaginary, and the virtual all
encourage us to buy into these collective fictions despite the real, and when
there's nothing left to encourage us to buy into those collective fictions it
adapts, sometimes these adaptations are subtle, seemingly insignificant, and
sometimes the adaptations are cataclysmic.

> To use one of  Žižek's examples: who was it, for instance, who didn't know
> that  Really Existing Socialism (RES) was shabby and corrupt?  Not any of the
> people, who were all too aware of its shortcomings;  nor any of the
> government administrators, who couldn't but know.  No, it was the big Other
> who was the one deemed not to  know -  who wasn't allowed to know -   the
> quotidian reality of  RES.  Yet the distinction between what the big Other
> knows, i.e.  what is officially accepted, and what is widely known and

> that allows 'ordinary' social reality to function.  When the illusion that

> Khrushchev's speech in 1965, in which he 'admitted' the failings of the
> Soviet state, was so momentous.  It  is not as if anyone in the party was
> unaware of the atrocities and corruption carried out in its name, but
> Khrushchev's announcement made it impossible to believe any more that the big
> Other was ignorant of them.  

The 2008 banking crisis is an example of the role the Symbolic plays in
capitalism realism--that while we individually internalize the faults of
capitalism, it is not registered by the big Other, and thus it remains. Zizek
illustrates this with a joke about a madman who, when cured of believing he is
a kernel of corn and is released from care, promptly returns after encountering
a chicken. The surprised doctor asks "But why, you are cured of believing
you're a kernel of corn!" To which the madman replies, "Yes, but does the
chicken know?" We are aware that capitalism is terrible,  and yet we
unconciously ask ourselves "But does the big Other know?" and thus it remains
because to us it has not been registered by the big Other.  Another example of
Zizek's language, "the Symbolic," is given, illustrated through PR, branding,
and advertising, whereby the corporation's true nature is _sheathed_:

> Ratner precisely tried to circumvent the Symbolic and "tell it how it is,"
> describing the inexpensive jewelry his shops sold as "crap" in an
> after-dinner speech. But the consequence of Ratner making this judgment
> _official_ were immediate, and serious - £500m  was wiped off the value of
> the company and he lost his job. Customers might previously have known that
> the jewelry Ratners sold was poor quality, but the big Other didn't know; as
> soon as it did, Ratners collapsed.

It is through _the big Other_ which capitalist ideology is reinforced through
these terms in understanding how this collective fiction is maintained:

  * The imaginary of perpetual growth. The imaginary is the layer aside reality
    we perceive and value equally.
  * The symbolic of work and consumption. The symbolic is how we interact
    through the big Other.
  * The real of exploitation and environmental destruction. The real may be
    something that is even fully actualized among individuals, but they are
    submerged in the "collective fiction" of the big Other.

I like the way [Zimbardo's _The Lucifer
Effect_](https://archive.org/details/TheLuciferEffectUnderstandingHowGoodPeopleTurnEvilISBN9781400064113)
depicts the extremes of the big Other:

> Aberrant, illegal, or immoral behavior by individuals in service professions, 
> such as policemen, corrections officers, and soldiers, is typically labeled the mis- 
> deeds of "a few bad apples." The implication is that they are a rare exception and 
> must be set on one side of the impermeable line between evil and good, with the 
> majority of good apples set on the other side. But who is making the distinction? 
> Usually it is the guardians of the system, who want to isolate the problem in order 
> to deflect attention and blame away from those at the top who may be responsible 
> for creating untenable working conditions or for a lack of oversight or supervision.
> Again the bad apple-dispositional view ignores the apple barrel and its
> potentially corrupting situational impact on those within it. A systems
> analysis focuses on the barrel makers, on those with the power to design the
> barrel.

Kafka illustrates the structure of disavowal inherent to bureaucracy with a
quest to reach the authority who will finally resolve K's official
status. This quest can never end, because ultimately there are only officials
engaged in acts of interpretation about what the big Other's intentions are,
and that these acts of interpretation, deferrals of responsibility, are all the
big Other is. This makes me think of Graeber's _against policy (a tiny
manifesto)_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology:_

> The notion of “policy” presumes a state or governing apparatus which imposes
> its will on others. “Policy” is the negation of politics; policy is by
> definition something concocted by some form of elite, which presumes it knows
> better than others how their affairs are to be conducted. By participating in
> policy debates the very best one can achieve is to limit the damage, since the
> very premise is inimical to the idea of people managing their own affairs.

There isn't a need for self and managerial surveillance. The effect of knowing
whether you will be observed or not will inevitably result not in quality, but
diligence as a bureaucrat. The self-surveillance of teachers provides an
illustration of what reinforces the participation/belief in the big Other, that
"collective narrative:"

  * The Imaginary: If we pass these metrics we are a great school
  * Symbolic: People gear education toward success on these metrics
  * Reality: [Math class needs a makeover (TED
    Talk)](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_meyer_math_curriculum_makeover).
    Students learn to pass tests, not to have deep, fundamental understandings.

All of this is packaged nicely by this paragraph in Capitalist Realism:

> There are certainly conspiracies in capitalism, but the problem is that they
> are themselves only possible because deeper level structures allow them to
> function. "Does anyone really think, for instance, that things would improve if
> we replaced the whole managerial and banking class with a whole new set of
> ("better") people? Surely, on the contrary, it is evident that the vices are
> engendered by the structure, and that while the structure remains the vices
> will reproduce themselves."

Capitalist Realism outlines these methods of change:

  * Remove business ontology from (public) services. In regard to LRC I think
    about our "key performance indicators."
  * Produce a viable alternative. LRC needs to not only research and prepare
    for the unintuitive caveats of real implementations of leaderlessness, but
    it needs to balance this with real-world application and experimentation, and
    proposals for methods for accomplishing such.
  * Assertion of worker autonomy (as opposed to control by management)
  * Withdraw, evade forms of labor which "will only be noticed by the
    management which have no effect on the delivery[...] but which
    managerialism cannot do without." Reject these managerial-types of labor (such
    as auditing). Institute industrial action against managerialism in general.
  * Realize the unhealthiness of these systems

This is a powerful conclusion to the book:

> It is clear that consumer self-regulation and the market will not by themselves
> avert environmental catastrophe. Unlimited license (re: ceaseless "progress" in
> hedonism) leads to misery & disaffectionment, then limitations placed on desire
> are likely to quicken, rather than deaden, it. In any case, rationing of some
> sort is inevitable. The issue is whether it will be collectively managed, or
> wheter it will be imposed by authoritarian means when it is already too late.
> Quite what forms this collective management should take is an open question,
> one that can only be resolved practically and experimentally.

It is then apparent that the priority is to bypass the symbolic, much like
Ratner and Khrushchev did, in a sense making it beyond a doubt that this
collective fiction we've bought into, the big Other, can no longer possibly
believe its narrative and it must adapt. The Leaderlessness Research Club
provides the revolutionary action of real world application of leaderless
organization which will be a part of the first steps in this process in
realizing the alternative.

A method of combatting the statist ideology is summarized well by
the final pages of the book:

  * Produce a viable alternative, e.g., argue a delivery where neoliberalism
    has failed: a massive reduction of bureaucracy.
  * Struggle over work and who controls it, assertion of worker autonomy (as
    opposted to control by management) together with a rejection of certain
    kinds of labor (such as auditing) which managerialism cannot do without
  * Reject business ontologies
  * Realize the unhealthiness of certain systems...
  * Resolve things through collective management, practically and experimentally

Isn't it interesting how close the goals of Leaderlessness Research Club are to
all of this just through the concept of leaderlessness?  Many of us LRC members
who are marginalized people (trans femmes, notably) had already experienced the
real of capitalist-statism as individually-internalized realities, but only
when we united did the collective fiction crack, through which the real glares
at us, challenging us to change it. Related reads:

### Timeless Tips for 'Simple Sabotage'

Here’s a list of five particularly timeless tips from the Simple Sabotage Field
Manual:

  1.  Managers and Supervisors: To lower morale and production, be pleasant to
inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against
efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.
  1.  Employees: Work slowly. Think of ways to increase the number of movements
needed to do your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one; try to make a
small wrench do instead of a big one.
  1. Organizations and Conferences: When possible, refer all matters to
committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the
committees as large and bureaucratic as possible. Hold conferences when there
is more critical work to be done.
  1. Telephone: At office, hotel and local telephone switchboards, delay putting
calls through, give out wrong numbers, cut people off “accidentally,” or forget
to disconnect them so that the line cannot be used again.
  1. Transportation: Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy
personnel. Issue two tickets for the same seat on a train in order to set up an
“interesting” argument.

### The Tyranny of Structurelessness

_The Tyranny of Structurelessness_ by Jo Freeman references the
anarcha-feminism movement, specifically outlining how when powers remain opaque
and informalized, they're at their most tyrannical. At-a-glance Freeman may
seem to suggest that there cannot possibly be transparency within any anarchist
movment, but I believe the bigger takeaway underlines the importance of formal
systems of organization. My friend Xax told me about this article some years
ago.

"There's no such thing as structureless group," Jo Freeman poses that there are
only formal and informal structures and that structurelessness (informal
structure) only serves to mask power:

> A "laissez faire" group is about as realistic as a "laissez faire" society;
> the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish
> unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established
> because the idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation of
> informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly "laissez faire" philosophy
> did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing control over
> wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented the government
> from doing so.

The informal structure (especiall of of unstructured groups) forms the basis for elites.
An elite is a small group of people who have power over a larger group which
they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group,
often without their knowledge or consent.  (REWORD: pagerism)
Freeman illustrates elitism as nepotism: that people with external friendships
to each other will have communication networks, consulting each other in
decisions, often sharing in the same values and orientations not even by
conspiracy: those involved with these networks will have more power than those
who don't. Sometimes two or more of such "networks" or "friend groups" will
compete for power within the group. Informal communication networks are
invitably exclusive and elitist. A comparison is drawn that informal systems of
male-hedgamony are one such network of elites, and that much struggle in
women's movement has been to formalize the inclusion of women..? 

Political impotence and principles of democratic structuring.... some key points I found relevant:

  * Task oriented
  * High degree of communication
  * Delegation, including responsibility for whatever delegated
  * Distribution of authority
  * Rotation of tasks among individuals
  * Allocation of tasks along rational criteria.
  * Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible.
  * Equal access to resources needed by the group.
  * Structure of the group formalized
  * Everyone is aware of the rules of how decisions are made; open and
    available to everyone
  * For everyone to have the opportunity to participate the structure must be
    explicit (formalize the rules!)

### Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making

"Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to
Widespread Agreement" by Tim Hartnett is the first book we discussed a the LRC
book club. I first came across the CODM model on [the Wikipedia page on
consensus
decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making). At
the time I was the president of the nonprofit I founded, [Hypatia Software
Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org). I was attempting to incorporate
the voices of the very members the nonprofit benefitted, since the board of
directors was at time disconnected from the members' concerns.

Tim Hartnett's background as a marriage counselor and facilitator, a PHD in
psychology, shines as this decision-making approach not only addresses
pragmatic concerns, but the emotional interplay which ultimately determines the
fairness of the process.

When Leaderlessness Research Club started it initially was only a software
project called "Dividita." The goal of Dividita was to provide a
decision-making model that would make heirarchicalless/leaderless organization
easily replicatable to successfully run organizations (businesses, art
collectives, nonprofits, etc.). I had found some success with Hypatia Software
Organization and I had experimented with other leaderless groups and having
experienced the feasibility, effectiveness, and fairness which they provided, I
thought it was important to make such a process easily replicatable and usable.
David Graeber defines _revolutionary action_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as direct action which subverts
the necessity for the state, the application of real leaderless solutions, and the
proposal of such systems, in fact David Graeber states:

> It’s not just that anarchism does not tend to have much use for high
> theory.  It’s that it is primarily concerned with forms of pracice; it insists,
> before anything else, that one’s means must be consonant with one’s ends; one
> cannot create freedom through authoritarian means; in fact, as much as
> possible, one must oneself, in one’s relations with one’s friends and allies,
> embody the society one wishes to create

> The key term in the new movement is “process,” by which is meant,
> decision-making process. In North America, this is almost invariably done
> through some process of finding consensus. This is as I mentioned much less
> ideologically stifling than it may sound because the assumption behind all good
> consensus process is that one should not even try to convert others to one’s
> overall point of view; the point of consensus process is to allow a group to
> decide on a common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and down,
> then, proposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until one ends
> up with something everyone can live with.

_Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making_ does exactly that, with some exceptions,
it offers a feasible, tried and tested method for consensus...

The CODM model consists of seven steps:

  1. Framing the topic
  2. Open discussion
  3. Identifying underlying concerns
  4. Collaborative proposal building
  5. Choosing a direction
  6. Synthesizing a final proposal

### Hellenistic History and Culture

_Hellenistic History and Culture_ by Peter Green begins with a forward on the
perspective from which the book extrapolates new information:

> A distrust of all ideologies has altered old views of ancient political
> structures, and feminism has also changed earlier assessments. The current
> emphasis on multiculturalism has consciously deemphasized the Western,
> Greco-Roman tradition, and Nubians, Bactrians, and other subject peoples of the
> time are receiving attention in their own right, not just as recipients of
> Greco-Roman culture.

> History, like Herakleitos' river, never stands still. These essays share a
> collective sense of discovery and a sparking of new ideas—they are a welcome
> beginning to the reexploration of a fascinatingly complex age.

### Writing Culture

Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI.

Hopefully helps with field research. This in the vein of postcolonial theory,
related to _Can the Subaltern Speak?_ by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and The
Ignorant Schoolmaster, and perhaps even Capitalist Realism, which poses what
Zizek defined as "ideology:" that which we don't know we know; the systemic
proliferation of statist, capitalist ideology into academia.

### Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology

_Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology_ by David Graeber explores a
_fragmented_ outline for the slow accumulation of revolutionary action to
evolve the big Other.  Graeber begins with defining the the type of project
which anarchism is in relation to Marxism, that anarchism are largely schools
of practices, and Marxism schools of authors. This theme is key--_anarchism is
a practice_. Even looking at [Graeber's
Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidgraeber) (accessed 2018-05-13) is this
echoed, his bio reads "I see anarchism as something you do not an identity so
don't call me the anarchist anthropologist."

Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI. I thought this book would be
relevant to LRC because it provokes thought deeper than the system itself,
while simultaneously concerning itself with a framework for these systems
(which Graeber calls "an anthropology.").

Graeber uses anthropology to analyze the inherent structures behind political
theories.  From this context Graeber equates the state to the perpetuation of
the kinship system; produces the true nature of "revolution" as a contradiction
to the ideology of great cataclysmic breaks, e.g "the French Revolution created
modernity;" and exemplifies anarchy's historical role. In general Graeber
describes "anarchist anthropology" as a method for managing the big Other.

### Gender Trouble

_Gender Trouble_ by Judith Butler starts off by talking about how the ridgid
binary and narrative authority of gender creates a hierarchy of exclusion:

> In 1989 I was most concerned to criticize a pervasive heterosexual assumption
> in feminist literary theory. I shought to counter those views that made
> presumptions about the limits and propriety of gender and restricted the
> meaning of gender to received notions of masculinity and feminity. It was and
> remains my view that any feminist theory that restricts the meaning of gender
> int he presuppositions of its own practice sets up exclusionary gender norms
> within feminism, often with homophobic consequences. It seemed to me, and
> continues to seem, that feminism ought to be careful not to idealize certain
> expressions of gender that, in turn, produce new forms of hierarchy and
> exclusion. In particular, I opposed those regimes of truth that stipulated
> that certain kinds of gendered expressions were found to be false or

Talk about trap shit here. Narrative Authority, gender autonomy.

#### The Postmodern Condition

_The Postmodern Condition_ by Jean-Francois Lyotard...

Postmodernism as a postcolonial abstraction: the imaginary isolation of science
and societal abstraction; the death of meta...

"The ruling class is and will continue to be the class of decision makers. Even
now it is no longer composed of the traditional political class, but of a
composite layer of corporate leaders, high-level administrators, and the heads
of the major professional, labor, political, and religious organisations. "
Grand narratives are the analysis of history through a lense of an origin and
inevitabel destination, postmodernism destroys this narrative with more nuanced
understanding; Marxim analyzes history through the lense of class from the
means of labor to labor immancipation, and for anarchism from serfdom to
"increasingly democratic" means of governance--it is perhaps for this reason
that Graeber identifies not as an anarchist but as someone who believes that
anarchy is an action, that it is an anthropology, and that this is the ver
ystrength of anarchism: that is concerns itself far more with the action and
implmentation and practical, than aligning itself with grand narratives for
interpreting history and our trajectory through some sort of _grand narrative_,
and it is thus Graeber is a very postmodern anthropologist believer of
anarchist action.
Possibly in the vein of queer theory: where bisexuals are caught between due to
outmoded grand narratives of sexuality opression, TERFs exist in the same vein
of outmoded grand narratives of *sexual* opression.
