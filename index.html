<h1>LRC: Leaderlessness Research Club</h1>
<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to practically implement and experiment with forms of
collective management, paving the path for other organizations to follow.</p>
<p>How we achieve our mission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct and publish field research on existing organizations using
    collective management</li>
<li>Create and publish summaries, critiques, and reviews of existing materials
    on forms and anthropologies of (hopefully implementable) collective management</li>
<li>Facilitate discussions, offer presentations, and create general public
    events regarding implementing and experimenting with collective management</li>
<li>Offer feasible guides on implementation of great reductions of bureaucracy</li>
<li>Offer guides on eschewing surveillance in regard to business ontologies,
    how do withdrawal forms of labor which managerialism cannot do without</li>
<li>Publish original collective management implementation manuals and guidebooks,
    report on experiments regarding our real world example-implementations of
    these manuals and guidebooks, from the high level overall system to the
    components (like consensus)</li>
<li>Answer public questions on collective management implementation</li>
</ul>
