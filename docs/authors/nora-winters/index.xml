      <description>Starting Research with a Booklist Note: this article is incomplete and will be routinely updated for a while because I am impatient. I intend to make future posts elaborating on books and concepts mentioned herein, which I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to link to within this article.
I am summarizing knowledge from books I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently, while offering my own interpretation. I hope that not only will this booklist provide quality suggestions for the LRC&amp;rsquo;s book club, but that my summaries and conclusions will bring the LRC closer to its goal of creating an informed proposal for an Internet-based group decision-making process, in other words, a collective management system, to then be developed into a web app.</description>
