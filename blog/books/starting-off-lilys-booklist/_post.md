# Starting Off: Lily's Booklist

Here are some books I have in my possession as of now, of which I hope will
aid LRC in their goal of creating an informed proposal for an Internet-based
group decision-making process, which we will develop into an app. I also hope
these books will become part of the LRC book club!

For each book I'll try to provide:

  * A summary
  * The authors
  * Why I chose this book/found it relevant to LRC
  * How I found out about the book
  * Where to get the book

Here are some places I like to buy books from:

  * [May Day Books](http://maydaybookstore.org/): "Located in the exciting West
    Bank community in Minneapolis, May Day Books is a volunteer collective
    dedicated to selling left-wing literature." Since 1975.
  * [Magers & Quinn Booksellers](https://www.magersandquinn.com/)
  * [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/)

I will provide fuller analyses in their own blog posts and update this post
with links to the articles for each book/section.

## The Tyranny of Structurelessness

_The Tyranny of Structurelessness_ by Jo Freeman references the
anarcha-feminism movement, specifically outlining how when powers remain opaque
and informalized, they're at their most tyrannical. At-a-glance Freeman may
seem to suggest that there cannot possibly be transparency within any anarchist
movment, but I believe the bigger takeaway underlines the importance of formal
systems of organization. My friend Xax told me about this article some years
ago.

## Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making

"Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to
Widespread Agreement" by Tim Hartnett is the first book we discussed a the LRC
book club. I first came across the CODM model on [the Wikipedia page on
consensus
decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making). At
the time I was the president of the nonprofit I founded, [Hypatia Software
Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org). I was attempting to incorporate
the voices of the very members the nonprofit benefitted, since the board of
directors was at time disconnected from the members' concerns.

Tim Hartnett's background as a marriage counselor and facilitator, a PHD in
psychology, shines as this decision-making approach not only addresses
pragmatic concerns, but the emotional interplay which ultimately determines the
fairness of the process.

When Leaderlessness Research Club started it initially was only a software
project called "Dividita." The goal of Dividita was to provide a
decision-making model that would make heirarchicalless/leaderless organization
easily replicatable to successfully run organizations (businesses, art
collectives, nonprofits, etc.). I had found some success with Hypatia Software
Organization and I had experimented with other leaderless groups and having
experienced the feasibility, effectiveness, and fairness which they provided, I
thought it was important to make such a process easily replicatable and usable.
David Graeber defines _revolutionary action_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as direct action which subverts
the necessity for the state, the application of real leaderless solutions, and the
proposal of such systems, in fact David graber states:

> It’s not just that anarchism does not tend to have much use for high
> theory.  It’s that it is primarily concerned with forms of pracice; it insists,
> before anything else, that one’s means must be consonant with one’s ends; one
> cannot create freedom through authoritarian means; in fact, as much as
> possible, one must oneself, in one’s relations with one’s friends and allies,
> embody the society one wishes to create

> The key term in the new movement is “process,” by which is meant,
> decision-making process. In North America, this is almost invariably done
> through some process of finding consensus. This is as I mentioned much less
> ideologically stifling than it may sound because the assumption behind all good
> consensus process is that one should not even try to convert others to one’s
> overall point of view; the point of consensus process is to allow a group to
> decide on a common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and down,
> then, proposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until one ends
> up with something everyone can live with.

_Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making_ does exactly that, with some exceptions,
it offers a feasible, tried and tested method for consensus...

The CODM model consists of seven steps:

  1. Framing the topic
  2. Open discussion
  3. Identifying underlying concerns
  4. Collaborative proposal building
  5. Choosing a direction
  6. Synthesizing a final proposal

## Hellenistic History and Culture

_Hellenistic History and Culture_ by Peter Green begins by stating the new
lense from which this book extrapolates new information: feminism, Marxism,
more modern views, multiculturalism unveils a deemphasis of Western,
Greco-Roman tradition and Nubians, Bactrians and other subject peoples of the
time receive analysis of their own right, not just as reciepients of
Greco-Roman culture.

History, like Herakleitos' river, never stands still. These essays share a
collective sense of discovery and a sparking of new ideas—they are a welcome
beginning to the reexploration of a fascinatingly complex age. 

Peter Green's introduction ... 
reflects how misrepresentation happens through representation, the
postcolonial theory thing which weaves into Writing Culture, ...

## Capital

"Das Kapital" by Marx...

How could I *not* hear about this?

## Mutual Aid

_Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution_ by Peter Kropotkin...

I'm not sure if i heard about this through Brian Callahan first or simply
because its one fo the major anarchist texts...

## Grey Eminence

I heard of this through a Zizek talk...

Became interested in revisiting this after Zizek... I had watched the Crispen
Glvoer movie of the same title...

## The Politics of Fear

_The Politics of Fear: What Right-Wing Populist Discourses Mean_ by Ruth
Wodak...
Friend at LRC recommended this to me...

## Writing Culture

_Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography_ by James Clifford
(editor), George E. Marcus (editor), Mike Fortun (foreword), and Kim Fortun
(foreword). This is the 2010 version, "This seminal collection of essays
critiquing ethnography as literature is augmented with a new foreword by Kim
Fortun, exploring the ways in which Writing Culture has changed the face of
ethnography over the last 25 years."
Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI.

Hopefully helps with field research. This in the vein of post colonial theory,
related to _Can the Subaltern Speak?_ by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and The
Ignorant Schoolmaster, and perhaps even Capitalist Realism, which poses what
Zizek defined as "ideology:" that which we don't know we know; the systemic
proliferation of statist, capitalist ideology into academia.
