title: Lily's Initial Booklist
authors: Lily Mayfield

# Starting Off: Lily's Booklist

I am summarizing knowledge from books I've read recently, while offering my own
conclusion. I hope that not only will this booklist provide quality suggestions
for the LRC's book club. I also hope that my book/overall summaries and book/overall
conclusions will bring the LRC closer to its goal of bringing newfound
organizational research theory perspective for leaderlessness, ultimately
aiding LRC in creating an informed proposal for an Internet-based group
decision-making process, to be developed into a web app.

For each book I'll try to provide:

  * A summary
  * The author(s)
  * Why I chose this book/found it relevant to LRC
  * How I found out about the book
  * Eventually I'll add links later if more thorough blog posts are made about
    them

A general takeaway of this booklist is that the _ideology_ (as Zizek uses the
word) of statism infects our imagination (Capitalist Realism) and thus creates
a reflection of itself across a fractal of society. From pedegogical ideology
(The Ignorant Schoolmaster) to our anthropology (Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology) and thus the lense through which we both exhume history
(Hellenistic History and Culture) and document living history (Writing
Culture).

## Background

I founded [Hypatia Software Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org) some
years ago to help with addressing the class/trans femme intersection. In
retrospect, anarchy was a natural conclusion to a path of mutual aid and
consensus. While I think Hypatia is a good example of mutual aid in action, I
still think a lot better can be done given what we know now and what we learned
from (and continue to learn from) that experience. In is this essence of why
Leaderlessness Research Club is so important and amazing: it provides a way to
generalize these patterns in an approchable way so that other organizations can
apply them to things beyond our consideration.  In fact I would argue that this
is the necessary conclusion of it, since a bunch of ragtag trans people (as we
are) can't handle every single possible idea that can have these patterns
applied to them without resorting to some kind of hierarchical system that
would degenerate them slowly from the inside out.

Hypatia Software Organization is a system fostering mutual aid, generative
justice, that is outreach and ideological-warming, independent, but within
current capitalist statist modes of production. "Warming" as in the boiling
frog, whereby people not necessarily aware of the ideology support it
indirectly, whereby "socialism" is a call for communism within a Capitalist
Realism, "leaderlessness" is perhaps a call for anarchy within a "Statist
Realism." This warming gradually becomes a completely anarchist form of
governance and commodity production.

FOSS/web projects are moved by emergent social interactions, rather than
traditional corporate structures.
FOSS advocates were a good initial target, for whom a leaderless system
could be considered more palatable then most other types, simply due to
prior exposure to emergent patterns and how they craft software.

I was confronted by classism within Hypatia (ironic considering its
intentions!) when there was a push by the Board of Directors to remove or
restrict the cash relief program, largely due to a particular homeless
beneficiary. I viewed this disconnect as the inherent misrepresentation of
representation. The path I used to actually represent member's voices was to
actually incorporate their voices: consensus. Consensus is an anarchist
component, and as I studied it more I finally arrived at _leaderlessness_.

David Graeber defines "revolutionary action" in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as:

> A revolution on a world scale will take a very long time. But it is also
> possible to recognize that it is already starting to happen. The easiest way
> to get our minds around it is to stop thinking about revolution as a
> thing--"the" revolution, the great catacylsmic break--and instead ask "what
> is revolutionary action?" We could then suggest: revolutionary action is any
> collective action which rejects and therefore confronts, some power of
> domination and in doing so, reconstitutes social relations--even within the
> collectivity--in that light. Revolutionary action does not necessarily have
> to aim to topple governments. Attempts to create autonomous communities in
> the face of power (using Castoriadis' definition here: ones that constitute
> themselves, collectively make their own rules or principles of operation, and
> continually reexamine them), would, for instance, be almost by definition
> revolutionary acts. And history shows us that the continual accumulation of
> such acts can change (almost) everything.

I absolutely think graeber is taking the right approach here, particularly as
breaking into underprivileged communities and working with them to improve
their situations is concerned. That is, I'm performing my own "revolutionary
action" by pushing the _reality_ of leaderless systems.

## Maybe delete?

"Realism," of making global decisions. capitalist realism provides a language
framework for describing "realism" which is similar to zizek's "ideology" i.e.,
things we don't know we know . capitalist realism means that we can't imagine
life without capitalism, the saying "well capitalism isnt great but its better
than anything else!" which is a reductive and gross simplification of the
concept but its in the right ballpark.

c: I think
Licklider also had things to say about this kind of emergent activity if you
look hard enough, and cyberneticians also came close to it tho they reasoned
more in terms of "how can we quantify and automate the breadth of already
existing human knowledge" rather then focusing on emergent activity
specifically.

C: This also helps to provide an alternative to the naive
libertarian/technocommunist/"fuck you I've got mine except let me virtue signal
about how I'm helping these poor poc queers while ignoring everyone else"
mindset that seems to be endemic in silicon valley politics



## Questions & answers

Q: Are all these political? Tyranny of Structurelessness, The Politics of
Fear, Writing Culture, etc., give me that impression.

A: Depends on what you mean by "political." For example, The Politics of Fear
gives us a framework for rhetoric, Tyranny of Structurelessness a framework for
unstructured opression, etc. I see this kind of political theory as a
larger-scoped organizational reserach theory, it is the framework which
describes the operations of society akin to anthropology (which is why Graeber
highlights this what should be more of a glaring necessity of interdiscpline).

Q: I see you include books which don't tackle leaderlessness, like Capitalist
Realism and Das Kapital. I'm not sure what they have to do with anything?

A: "Capitalist Realism," for example, is composed of sources like Zizek who are
statist anti-capitalists, however, the framework it provides is a useful
language for describing larger concepts.

Q: however these do sound like they're framed in a highly academic, and a very
particular kind of academic at that, tone and language.  I strongly dislike
academia, principally for the politics and that they are completelydisconnected
with reality.  Academics, people who've spent their entire adult life living in
the sphere of academia don't understand what life outside an ivory tower is
like.

A: Then you'd probably enjoy reading  "The Ignorant Schoolmaster." The ideology
(Zizek) of statism affects this too--pedagogical ideology as academia, again,
statism casts a reflection of itself here as well, that even in our concept of
education it is a statist conceptualization: education is a prescriptive
system, the teacher and the student.  In the first chapter of _Fragments of an
Anarchist Anthropology_, Graeber delvies into anarchy being inherently
incompatible with academia today. That one of the core features of anarchy is
concerning itself more with application than high theory, however this doesn't
omit room for high theory.  Consider this, you talk about how people in the
ivory tower are completely dissonant on what's going on around them--this is a
result of that state mentality, it is that when you become a teacher that you
are "house trained" and that you inevitably lose connection as you become
ever-submerged in an academic culture which demands you speak their language
and articulate their ideals.  I trace this back to again: the reflection of
statism reflects itself across a fractal of society. _Writing Culture_ talks
about how academia can never be representative so long at it is statist (as
does the ignorant schoolmaster and David Graeber's fragments of an anarchist
anthropology).

Q: So when you say "statist" do you mean the presence of a power dynamic?  Or
do you mean the presence of some organized hierarchical structure of society ?
I still fail to see how it's germane to the teacher/student relationship as it
exists now and how it has existed for ages

A: David Graeber poses a falseness of the postmodern, of "modernity", because
from the anthropological identification of capitalism and statism they are
kinship systems, kinship systems which have persisted, that fundamental
societal interplay negating any sense of postmodernity through some great
cataclysmic change (in fact change has never operated this way, but that's
another topic).  The conceptualization of a shift from kinship systems to
something greater, "an enlightenment" of democracy shifting us away from the
aforementioned, is this very kind of "cataclysmic change" I specify as being
nonexistant, and thus no such postmodernism exists.  When I say "state" I mean
exclusive power, the prescriptive, the policy, the ability a nonmajority to
hold exclusive power as a few over the many. If you want an introduction to
anarchist theory _Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology_ offers a great
framework.

Q: What scale are you talking about in terms of organization?

A: Again, I mean: "[the state] creates a reflection of itself across a fractal
of society." at every scale of society, affecting organization at every scale,
statism is an anthropological way of our life--a thing we do not know we know.
For example, postcolonial theory states that those from outside of a culture
misrepresent those they attempt to document inherently because they are
representatives and those observations are formed from an exclusive 

Q: Describe how Zizek uses the word _ideology_, and what "a reflection of
itself a cross a fractal of society" means more precisely, since I am
unfamiliar with Zizek and I don't know if there are subtleties to the meaning
of the latter beyond "you can observe this phenomenon in a variety of scales in
society."

A:  Zizek uses the word "ideology" to mean "what we don't know we know" and
uses that framework to describe the danger of capitalism is that it does not
use the old repressive methods of Stalin-esque propaganda, but rather
implements itself through this kind of "ideology," again, in regard to "a
reflection of itself across a fractal of society" means that statism and
capitalism imbues itself its mentality its essence its "ideology" (Zizek again
here as we talked about) through everything we do because it is exactly that:
that which we do not know we know, and as such, it is our understanding of
organization and interplay for any scale of society.  It is this interesting point
Zizek delivers: this is how capitalism is maintained, rather than, again,
Stalin-esque maintenance through propaganda.

Q: Why do you disagree with Zizek's conclusions that a state is necessary?

A:  Because his conceptions of anarchist modes of decision-making are
outmoded, because the advent of technology brings possibilities of automating
consensus and direct democracy. However, Zizek's views are more complicated
than this (e.g., the selfish locality in a globalist network of humanity).

Q: Who decides which methods are used?

A: This is a complicated topic. It's both that revolutionary action is the
subversion of the state by basically replacing it, but on the other hand within
the state it is ultimately controlled by the state and the general anthropology
interplay

Q: How do you counteract the desire for power?  I can't imagine a world in
which people don't pursue the accumulation of power.  Perhaps there exist a
group of people whose predisposition is to exist at the top of a social
hierarchy. There are those who will connive to usurp the structures in place to
gain power to use for their benefit, but if you have any concentration of power
it inherently becomes one in which a hierarchy exists. I see anarchy as a
highly unstable system a high energy state, so to speak, in which the system
will try to reach a more stable equilibrium by a redistribution of power (its
actors pursuing this end). On that topic, how does a military without a
hierarchy exist?

A: It is true in any system that people will have a desire for power. Please
"The Tyranny of Structurelessness" and my analysis of it.  Also, _Mutual Aid: A
Factor of Evolution_ is really good as it summarizes Darwinian relation to
human anthropology (Kropotkin was a close friend of Darwin).  I recommend it
because mutual aid does seem to be THE factor of the world's most proliferated
species. People can govern through a formalized general agreeance and enforce
it in the same way.  That is, what about the concentration of power of
confederate will?  As long as the people get to have order over the military's
actions anarchies can obviously create societal contracts with representative
structures like nuclear facilities and the military where snap judgements are
required.  The important thing is that ultimately the policy and direction of
society is set by a ruling few and that these services answer to those ruling
elite and not the general populous, i.e., in this case the military holds no
exclusive power over "policy." I hate to talk about "the military" and "policy"
in this way and in the scope of this booklist, but it does seem to draw some
useful parallels and analogies to other services an anarchy might
utilize/render.

Q: So the mob dictates the actions of others? Isn't this tyranny of the
majority?

A: If you utilize the concepts, the ideology, behind _The Tyranny of the
Majority_ then you have to accept that democracy itself is futile.  I and
others have proposed the tyranny of tyranny itself is the real hazard.  Also,
if you believe this, then why trust people to elect representatives in the
first place?  We instead are forced into a system in which a kinship system
allows us to only vote for rich families who have long maintained state
structures.

Q: But won't abuses of power always happen because power exists and people are animals?

A: So why aren't you an anarchist? Zimbardo posed it is not the "bad apples,"
but rather the ill soil creating toxic trees. Anarchism is fundamentally posing
that the state creates the ill soil, enabling power to be abused by the few who
will act in disregard of the many (those we label as the exceptions, the "bad
apples").  We should collectively and democratically decide, as a people, what
our societal agreement is, which these agreements can affect/effect services of
society, even those with "necessary hierarchy" like the military, those
services are still ultimately accountable and managed by the people, rather
than what we have now where elites decide to go to war on our behalf (Iraq,
Afghanistan, Libya, etc.).  Historically war has not been the role of the
people but rather the role of people in power to decide.  If you seem to agree
with these ideals, then why prevent yourself--why not aim for something better?
Surely statist capitalism is not the end all be all (in fact _Capitalist
Realism_ is a book which describes the problem in society now where we cannot
imagine existence without capitalism [and i would say statism as well]).  "If
you're not a utopianist you're schmuck," and so anarchism provides a framework
you apparently agree with that we can move toward through revolutionary actions
of making anarchism paradigm.

Q: I think that any violent or sudden means to change society will inherently
result in a worse system and I think that the system is too entrenched to be
changed nonviolently.

A: I personally am a pacifist-but this is likely a position of privilege. It's
important to realize legislative violence exists and that almost all "peaceful
movements" that drastically changed society have been accompanied by an equal
violent movement along side it.  So it's conflicting but ultimately I would say
that 1. I'm a pacifist and I don't believe killing people to get things done,
and 2. Zizek brings up how in _V for Vendetta_ ends with the government being
overthrown. The problem is what happens in _V for Vendetta: Part 2_, what
happens after they've overthrown the government requires a specific plan or
something worse will take its place.  I don't believe in violent overthrows,
but this does trace back to something important: that anarchism is concerned
with the practical implementation, the actual plan of an alternative to
capitalist statism. This is the failing of the left: an inability to provide an
actual alternative rather than kneejerk "poverty is bad" type protests .  Zizek
and capitalism realism talk about this tendency in GREAT detail and even talks
about how this kind of thing is not only systemic of capitalism, but it
supports capitalism as it overvaluates belief, i.e., "I believe capitalism is
bad and therefore it is okay for me to be complicit in its operation," either
fullstop or in the self-tricking like citizen-level environmentalism or
choosing the ethical product will ultimately solve its issues--this very
concept of capitalist realism in which we cannot create an alternative to
capitalism, but can only imagine remedying its worst excesses.

Q: I don't think you need a leader for everything you participate in, that
forcing a leadership role isn't wise.

A: I think its most important that people who are ultimately a part of a system
ultimately have control over that system and regardless of who they employ to
render their will (not in the republic sense because this generates exclusive
power over the aforementioned), as we talked about with military.

Q: none of this seems like its something practical that we can control

A: You can subvert the state through the revolutionary action of creating
paradigm through implementation of anarchism.  The Black Panthers realized
this through direct action by implementing services like: breakfast program,
lawyer tiplines, etc.  The biggest issue in leftist politics rn is actually
formalizing an explicit alternative. Anarchism has taken the place of Marxism
in modern academic culture it is a prohibited speech except where used in
coded language through topics like mutual aid, direct democracy, etc., but it
is in these practical applications that the paradigm is set, the revolutionary
action is played, as was Marxism, increasingly anarchist application and theory
becomes an inevitability, so did Marxism entering the sphere introduce to the
public acceptance of "socialism," and a possibility of someone like Bernie
Sanders (though this again is in the "worst excesses" thing we talked about
earlier, this surely exemplifies what I speak of here).

## Can the Subaltern Speak

Spivak. Brian recommended. In vein of Writing Culture.

## The Tyranny of Structurelessness

_The Tyranny of Structurelessness_ by Jo Freeman references the
anarcha-feminism movement, specifically outlining how when powers remain opaque
and informalized, they're at their most tyrannical. At-a-glance Freeman may
seem to suggest that there cannot possibly be transparency within any anarchist
movment, but I believe the bigger takeaway underlines the importance of formal
systems of organization. My friend Xax told me about this article some years
ago.

[The Tyranny of Structurelessness on Jo Freeman's website](http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)

## Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making

"Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to
Widespread Agreement" by Tim Hartnett is the first book we discussed a the LRC
book club. I first came across the CODM model on [the Wikipedia page on
consensus
decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making). At
the time I was the president of the nonprofit I founded, [Hypatia Software
Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org). I was attempting to incorporate
the voices of the very members the nonprofit benefitted, since the board of
directors was at time disconnected from the members' concerns.

Tim Hartnett's background as a marriage counselor and facilitator, a PHD in
psychology, shines as this decision-making approach not only addresses
pragmatic concerns, but the emotional interplay which ultimately determines the
fairness of the process.

When Leaderlessness Research Club started it initially was only a software
project called "Dividita." The goal of Dividita was to provide a
decision-making model that would make heirarchicalless/leaderless organization
easily replicatable to successfully run organizations (businesses, art
collectives, nonprofits, etc.). I had found some success with Hypatia Software
Organization and I had experimented with other leaderless groups and having
experienced the feasibility, effectiveness, and fairness which they provided, I
thought it was important to make such a process easily replicatable and usable.
David Graeber defines _revolutionary action_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as direct action which subverts
the necessity for the state, the application of real leaderless solutions, and the
proposal of such systems, in fact David graber states:

> It’s not just that anarchism does not tend to have much use for high
> theory.  It’s that it is primarily concerned with forms of pracice; it insists,
> before anything else, that one’s means must be consonant with one’s ends; one
> cannot create freedom through authoritarian means; in fact, as much as
> possible, one must oneself, in one’s relations with one’s friends and allies,
> embody the society one wishes to create

> The key term in the new movement is “process,” by which is meant,
> decision-making process. In North America, this is almost invariably done
> through some process of finding consensus. This is as I mentioned much less
> ideologically stifling than it may sound because the assumption behind all good
> consensus process is that one should not even try to convert others to one’s
> overall point of view; the point of consensus process is to allow a group to
> decide on a common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and down,
> then, proposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until one ends
> up with something everyone can live with.

_Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making_ does exactly that, with some exceptions,
it offers a feasible, tried and tested method for consensus...

The CODM model consists of seven steps:

  1. Framing the topic
  2. Open discussion
  3. Identifying underlying concerns
  4. Collaborative proposal building
  5. Choosing a direction
  6. Synthesizing a final proposal

## Hellenistic History and Culture

_Hellenistic History and Culture_ by Peter Green begins with a forward on the
perspective from which the book extrapolates new information:

> A distrust of all ideologies has altered old views of ancient political
> structures, and feminism has also changed earlier assessments. The current
> emphasis on multiculturalism has consciously deemphasized the Western,
> Greco-Roman tradition, and Nubians, Bactrians, and other subject peoples of the
> time are receiving attention in their own right, not just as recipients of
> Greco-Roman culture.

> History, like Herakleitos' river, never stands still. These essays share a
> collective sense of discovery and a sparking of new ideas—they are a welcome
> beginning to the reexploration of a fascinatingly complex age.

I'm not sure if i heard about this through Brian Callahan first or simply
because its one fo the major anarchist texts...

Maybe delete this?

I heard of this through a Zizek talk...

## Bartleby, the Scrivener

_Bartleby, the Scrivner: A Story of Wall Street_ by Herman Melville...

Became interested in revisiting this after Zizek... I had watched the Crispen

## The Politics of Fear

_The Politics of Fear: What Right-Wing Populist Discourses Mean_ by Ruth
Wodak...
Friend at LRC recommended this to me...

## Writing Culture

_Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography_ by James Clifford
(editor), George E. Marcus (editor), Mike Fortun (foreword), and Kim Fortun
(foreword). This is the 2010 version, "This seminal collection of essays
critiquing ethnography as literature is augmented with a new foreword by Kim
Fortun, exploring the ways in which Writing Culture has changed the face of
ethnography over the last 25 years."
Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI.

Hopefully helps with field research. This in the vein of postcolonial theory,
related to _Can the Subaltern Speak?_ by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and The
Ignorant Schoolmaster, and perhaps even Capitalist Realism, which poses what
Zizek defined as "ideology:" that which we don't know we know; the systemic
proliferation of statist, capitalist ideology into academia.

https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0520266021/

## Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology

_Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology_ by David Graeber asks us to think
about the inherent anthropological structures behind political theories.
From this context Graeber unveils an equation of the state to kinship systems,
definitions for revolutionary action, the streangths of anarchy, and anarchy's
historical role (what anarchy has historically been concerned with).
Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI. I thought this book would be
relevant to LRC because it provokes thought deeper than the system itself,
while simultaneously concerning itself with a framework for these systems
(which Graeber calls "an anthropology.").

Graeber's sentiment is echoed in many of the books on this list, of Zizek's
concept of _ideology_, The Ignorant Schoolmaster's topic of systemic statism
(how the state embues itself into everything we do), that we not only must
become aware of our assumptions, the _anthropology_ of any system we may
implement.

## The Ignorant Schoolmaster

_The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation_ by 
Jacques Rancière. Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI...

Organizations_ by Ori Brafman and Rod A. Beckstorm.
Recommended to me by Brian Callahan of RPI.

Quite specifically aids in LRC's goal...
