title: Lily's Initial Booklist

# Starting Off: Lily's Booklist

Here are some books I have in my possession as of now, of which I hope will
aid LRC in their goal of creating an informed proposal for an Internet-based
group decision-making process.

For each book I'll try to provide:

  * A summary
  * The authors
  * Why I chose this book/found it relevant to LRC
  * How I found out about the book
  * Where to get the book

Here are some places I like to buy books from:

  * [May Day Books](http://maydaybookstore.org/): "Located in the exciting West
    Bank community in Minneapolis, May Day Books is a volunteer collective
    dedicated to selling left-wing literature." Since 1975.
  * [Magers & Quinn Booksellers](https://www.magersandquinn.com/)
  * [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/)

I will provide fuller analyses in their own blog posts and update this post
with links to the articles for each book/section.

## Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making

"Consensus-Oriented Decision-Making: The CODM Model for Facilitating Groups to
Widespread Agreement" by Tim Hartnett is the first book we discussed a the LRC
book club. I first came across the CODM model on [the Wikipedia page on
consensus
decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making). At
the time I was the president of the nonprofit I founded, [Hypatia Software
Organization](http://hypatiasoftware.org). I was attempting to incorporate
the voices of the very members the nonprofit benefitted, since the board of
directors was at time disconnected from the members' concerns.

When Leaderlessness Research Club started it initially was only a software
project called "Dividita." The goal of Dividita was to provide a
decision-making model that would make heirarchicalless/leaderless organization
easily replicatable to successfully run organizations (businesses, art
collectives, nonprofits, etc.). I had found some success with Hypatia Software
Organization and I had experimented with other leaderless groups and having
experienced the feasibility, effectiveness, and fairness which they provided, I
thought it was important to make such a process easily replicatable and usable.
David Graeber defines _revolutionary action_ in _Fragments of an Anarchist
Anthropology_ as direct action which subverts
the necessity for the state, the application of real leaderless solutions, and the
proposal of such systems.

The CODM model consists of seven steps:

  1. Framing the topic
  2. Open discussion
  3. Identifying underlying concerns
  4. Collaborative proposal building
  5. Choosing a direction
  6. Synthesizing a final proposal

## Hellenistic History and Culture

_Hellenistic History and Culture_ by Peter Green begins by stating the new
lense from which this book extrapolates new information: feminism, Marxism,
more modern views, multiculturalism unveils a deemphasis of Western,
Greco-Roman tradition and Nubians, Bactrians and other subject peoples of the
time receive analysis of their own right, not just as reciepients of
Greco-Roman culture.

History, like Herakleitos' river, never stands still. These essays share a
collective sense of discovery and a sparking of new ideas—they are a welcome
beginning to the reexploration of a fascinatingly complex age.
