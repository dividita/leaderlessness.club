        <p>I am summarizing knowledge from books I've read recently, while offering my own
interpretation. I hope that not only will this booklist provide quality
suggestions for the LRC's book club, but that my summaries and conclusions will
bring the LRC closer to its goal of creating an informed proposal for an
Internet-based group decision-making process, in other words, a collective
management system, to then be developed into a web app.</p>
