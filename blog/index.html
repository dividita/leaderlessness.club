        <p>I am summarizing knowledge from books I've read recently, while offering my own
conclusion. I hope that not only will this booklist provide quality suggestions
for the LRC's book club. I also hope that my book/overall summaries and book/overall
conclusions will bring the LRC closer to its goal of bringing newfound
organizational research theory perspective for leaderlessness, ultimately
aiding LRC in creating an informed proposal for an Internet-based group
decision-making process, to be developed into a web app.</p>
