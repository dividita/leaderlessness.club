# LRC: Leaderlessness Research Club

**Our mission** is to make leaderlessness accessible and practical for all
scales of organization, from informal collectives to large formal businesses by
increasing the awareness and amount of information supporting this goal.

How we achieve our mission:

  * Conduct and publish field research and general materials regarding
    leaderless organization
  * Facilitate discussion, presentations, events on the topic of leaderless
    organization, and make summaries available to general public
  * Increase accessibility of new/original and pre-existing materials on leaderlessness
  * Write about running leaderless organizations, e.g., decision-making
    process, proposal building, law, experiences/anecdotes
  * Answer public questions on leaderlessness
  * Create reports, publish research finding
  * Dogfood/experiment with LRC's formalized proposals for group
    decision-making models, based on LRC's research
